### Chekote's Modpack for Minecraft 1.10.2

This new version of my long-running mod pack will now be managed by the [Curse Launcher](https://mods.curse.com/client). It's a great tool that really simplifies the management and installation of updates.

It'll also provide a much simpler installation process and a nice interface for the mod-pack users to browse the installed mods and get more information about them.
